> LitLLM is a powerful AI toolkit that transforms how researchers write literature reviews using advanced Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to create accurate, well-structured related work sections in minutes rather than hours or days.

## What is LitLLM?

LitLLM is a tool that helps researchers write literature reviews with the assistance of Large Language Models (LLMs). Writing literature reviews is one of the most time-consuming aspects of academic research, particularly in rapidly evolving fields like machine learning. LitLLM addresses this challenge by decomposing the task into two key components:

1. **Retrieval**: Finding the most relevant papers for your research
2. **Generation**: Creating a coherent, well-structured literature review based on the retrieved papers

## How It Works

LitLLM follows principles of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG):

1. **Keyword Extraction**: LLMs identify meaningful keywords from your research abstract
2. **Multi-Strategy Search**: Combines keyword-based and embedding-based search to query academic databases (Google Scholar, OpenAlex)
3. **Re-ranking with Attribution**: An LLM re-ranks search results to prioritize the most relevant papers 
4. **Structured Generation**: Creates a literature review following a plan-based approach that organizes the content meaningfully

## Key Features

- **Hybrid Retrieval**: Combines keyword and embedding-based search for optimal coverage
- **Attribution-based Re-ranking**: Prioritizes papers by relevance and importance
- **Plan-based Generation**: Creates structured, coherent literature reviews with fewer hallucinations
- **Interactive Interface**: User-friendly web interface for generating literature reviews

## Interface
> Note: the current interface has some new features not shown in the screenshot below (exporting citation, adding papers directly, high-level plan generation)

To use LitLLM:
1. Provide your research idea or abstract in the textbox
2. Select papers from the search results to base your literature review on
3. (Optional) Provide a writing plan to guide the generation of literature review
4. Generate literature review!

## Papers

LitLLM is based on the following two papers:
